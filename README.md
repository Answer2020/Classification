# PCDA-SAE
This repository contains the implementation of the PCDA-SAE method developed by Hadis Madani.

Start by running PCDASAE.m

Inside PCDASAE.m you can change the values of the hyperparameters in the section named "INITIALIZATION"

In this code, I have used the Pavia University HSI dataset as an example. This database can be reached from the following website:
