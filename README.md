# PCDA-SAE
This repository contains the implementation of the PCDA-SAE method developed by Hadis Madani.

Start by running PCDASAE.m

Inside PCDASAE.m you can change the values of the hyperparameters in the section named "INITIALIZATION"

In this code, I have used the Pavia University HSI dataset as an example. This public available database can be reached from the following website:

PCDA feature extraction is implemented based on: 
M. Imani and H. Ghassemian, “Principal component discriminant analysis for feature extraction and classification of hyperspectral images,” in 2014 Iranian Conference on Intelligent Systems (ICIS), pp. 1–5, Feb 2014.

Spectral and spatial information are combined based on:
Y. Chen, Z. Lin, X. Zhao, G. Wang, and Y. Gu, “Deep learning-based classification of hyperspectral data,” IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, vol. 7, pp. 2094–2107, June 2014.
